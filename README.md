#Oblivion lockpick in python pygame

Please open lp.py, please use up arrow key to move tumbler up, press space bar when you think it is at the top, track success and fails in top left corner

This has the feature from Oblivion where if you press up arrow key while a tumbler is falling, it will maintain values for stuck at top time and velocities, however, if the tumbler reaches the bottom, it will generate new values for stuck at top time and velocities
